updates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  don't  know  if  there  will  be  a  update for SYList in future. If this
happens,  I  will try to send Fred Fish a new version for the library disks.
The  other way is to look into BBSS or contact me directly. You have to make
sure,  that  you  have  send me enough money that I do not have costs when I
send  you  an  Update.  I can't say how long it takes to send you the update
(depends on the country, my timetable...) Usually it takes 1-2 Months.

### Introduction

introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This  program  is  able to list some information about files from a Yamaha
SY85 music synthesizer.

  As  if  you know (if you've got a SY85) the LCD-Display from the synth can
only  display  one  name of Voices, Performances, Songs etc. So I decided to
tidy  up  all  this  mess  and wrote PV85, also a list-program for SY85. The
results  weren't  so  good. It was very slow, not very system-conform and so
on.  I  stopped  to  develloping  on  PV85 and startet a universal SY85-file
lister. SYList was born.

Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Please  note,  that  I  don't  make  any warranties. This software is in an
experimental  stadium.  If  it  crashes  don't  loose  your faith (I hope it
won't...:-)

### storing
###
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
storing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 At first you've got to turn your Synthesizer on . (puhh this was hard!) Then
 load  the  desired  Sounds into the Synth. After that press the UTILITY-Key.
 Afterwards  you  select  Submode  DISK-Options.  There  you save the file as
 SY-All-Data or SYNTH ALL.


###
### reading

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reading
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The  Yamaha  SY85 Synthesizer is able to read and write 3½inch MS-DOS Disks.
 Therefore  you can use this Diskformat on AMIGAS. Make sure, that you've got
 Workbench  2.1  or  higher.  Mount the PC-DOS-Driver (e.g.: Mount PC0: [then
 Device DF0: could also read MS-DOS Disks])

   SYList  has  got  a very powerful template-string. You must remember, that
 SYList  is  written  for  the CLI (I mean the normal Amiga-Shell). After you
 have installed SYList correctly try to type in:

  >  SYLIST [ENTER]
  required argument is missing

   As you can see, SYList wants some arguments:

  >  SYList ?  [ENTER]
     File/A/M,All/S,Voices/S,Performances/S,Songs/S,Rhythms/S,
     Samples/S,NoAbout/S,LaTeX/S,Version/S,NoInit/S,Rows/K/N

  Here is the list of arguments:

  File/A/M:        You MUST give SYList a filename, otherwise it will refuse
                   to work. The filename is the 'stored' file.

  All/S:           The All option will automatically switch on the following
                   optiions: Voices, Performances, Songs, Rhythms, Samples

  Voices/S:        If you specify this keyword, SYList will try to list all
                   voices (memory 1-4).

  Performances/S:  SYList will list all performances.

  Songs/S:         All songs in the file will be displayed.

  Rhythms/S:       All rhythms in the file will be displayed.

  Samples/S:       All samples in the file will be displayed.

  NoAbout/S:       This switch will suppress the additional informations
                   from SYList like copyright etc.
                   
  LaTeX/S:	   Warning: This switch isn't working (yet!). In future it
                   will output the data in LaTeX-format. (for better tables!)
		   see also 'Todo'

  Version/S:       prints out the version

  NoInit/S:        This switch suppresses the output from Init-Voices/Performances
                   /Songs/Rhythms/Samples

  Rows/S:          Here you can specify the number of rows, when SYList
                   dumps all his stuff out.

### piping

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
piping
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This  is also very easy to do. Just use the normal AMIGA-PIPING (Yeah I like
 Amiga-Dos very much !)

  SYList [>OUTFILE] filename options

 e.g.

  SYList >SYListOutput.txt PC0:FACT_SET.G01  ALL [ENTER]
          ^     ^      ^
        this file is created by SYList
   In this case SYList will try to open the file FACT_SET.G01 on drive PC0:
   and then perform all actions it can to on it. Afterwards the data is
   saved in the current dir, with the filename "SYListOutput.txt".

 KNOWN PROBLMES:

  ° SYList doesn't stop working if it finds a non valid Yamaha-file.


###
### TODO
###
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
todo
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o GUI (Graphical User Inferface)
  o LaTeX OutPut
  o improved file-recognition
  o better documentation (LaTeX)
  o the AmigaGuide documentation has got to look better (e.g. OS3.0
    HyperText Commands like @underline... which are used by MultiView)
  o Deutsche Anleitung
  o Full user style guide interface
  o perhaps a SY85 editor (or even for TG500?) where you could do things
    like reorganisating, coping, renaming via the amiga. (this will take
    some time... see you in 2005..)

  o write to me, if you want to see a new feature

  ø rewrite all this stuff and make it much better ;-)

  My hardware was a A2000/30/25 with 7MB Ram and 450 MB HD

  Tested on: A2000 (Kick 2.04), A1200 (Kick 3.00), A4000 (Kick 3.00)

  If  you  have  programmed Sounds for your SY85 and want to swap then contact me 

                      ONLY   L E G A L  S T U F F !  

            I repeat it for the last idiot : ONLY LEGAL STUFF !
